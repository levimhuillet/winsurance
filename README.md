# Win-surance Weather Defense

Author: Levi Huillet

Theme: Tower Defense

Learning Objectives: Insurance (why it's important and choosing the best plan for your situation)



## Game Overview

You are managing a weather control station in the birthplace of all the world's storms and natural disasters.

As you can imagine, this location affords lots of research opportunities, but also high risks. Heavy infrastructure damage is common.

Luckily, you can buy insurance. You have the option to insure under a company called Win-surance Co.

## Tower Defense Aspects

- Oncoming elements wayfind from their starting point to the player's base.
- Players can place their towers on the grid in valid cells.
- Players can select from multiple types of towers, each of which have their own specifications (range, cost, etc.).
- The player's base has reserves that deplete whenever a natural disaster reaches it and the player must pay for the loss.

## Insurance Aspects

- Buy insurance against natural disasters (hurricanes, wildfires, and floods).
- Insurance is broken into premiums (paid every period) and deductibles (how much is paid out-of-pocket for each instance).
- Player can choose whether to buy insurance

## Miscellaneous Mechanics:
- Elements spawn out of Nexuses, which in turn spawn from Chaos Butterflies. Every butterfly that crosses the screen has a chance to instigate a Nexus pretty much anywhere, which grows and grows before moving to its designated spawn point. How many enemies a Nexus spawns depends on how much it grew during its growth stage.
- Nexuses have a slight chance to be severe weather, which results in more, stronger oncoming elements.
- Player receives a set amount of money per period to pay for towers and insurance

## Future plans:
- Tutorialize the game
- Balancing. Some levels are ridiculously difficult, others ridiculously easy.
